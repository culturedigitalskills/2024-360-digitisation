Spherical panorama images have entered the Cultural Heritage realm since the beginning of this technique. This is because these photographs give the viewer the possibility to explore the surrounding of a certain environment with ease. Spherical panorama images are in fact one of the best tool to visualise a complete representation of a cultural environment at a specific point of where the photograph would have been taken. This is also enhanced when associated with Virtual Tours (not to be confused with 3D virtual tours which come from video-games techniques). In this section however we will concentrate only on a single spherical photograph digitaisation, because the creation and the publication of 360 virtual tours is out of the scope of this workshop. The article: [**Panoramic 360◦ Sphere: Digitization and Mobilization of Cultural Heritage Site and Story Visualizing of History for Cultural Tourism, by Ylenia Cariani**](https://www.silvher.eu/2021/01/04/panoramic-360%E2%97%A6-sphere-digitization-and-mobilization-of-cultural-heritage-site-and-story-visualizing-of-history-for-cultural-tourism/) highlights why digitasation with spherical panorama has its benefit especially for Cultural Tourism.
Another article by Wei Ren and Xianhong Chen evaluates the [**Online Online 360° Virtual Reality World Heritage Site During COVID-19**](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2020-0188/html)

Reflect on how the examples described could 
be applicable to the objects and
environments you would like to document.

List ideas where spherical panoramas might be a useful documentation
technology.
