## Basic setup for all methods
There are basic steps that have to be taken into consideration when setting up for a spherical panorama shooting session. Here is a list of basic setup points:

- Use a good quality tripod for maximum stabilisation and mount the camera on it

- Keep the sun on the side of the camera and not directly into the lens if you can.

- Use a small tripod so not to get it in the shot.

NICOLA PLEASE: add basics of setting up a camera. You can use some of the text below. Explain why a timer is needed. Be more comprehensive.

As we saw in the previous section this is one of the technique for taking spherical panorama photographs. While using this technique we should follow these specific steps:

- Mount the camera on the tripod

- Keep the camera straight (portrait shooting is ideal when using this technique because of the extended coverage)

- Set camera to manual focus so that it does not change between different shots

- Start shooting by rotating the camera of a minimum 60 degree angle (this depends on the focal length of your lens) Please refer to the [previous section](difference-between-techniques.Rmd) to check the amount of pictures to be taken.

- to speed up the process you can use a motorized camera mount synchronized with a timer of the camera. In this case:

  - setup the number of picture to take in your camera
  
  - setup the interval time on your mount

Although these steps are specific for the Insta360 Pro 2, they remain easily applicable to other types of 360 cameras:
