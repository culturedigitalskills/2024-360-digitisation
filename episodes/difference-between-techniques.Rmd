## Multiple-shot rotating (Pano Kit) DSLR camera

This technique uses a regular **DSLR camera, a compact camera or a mobile phone**, accompanied by **rotating mechanism** such as the [Matterport](https://matterport.com/axis) for DSLR cameras or the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-flow) for mobile phones.


 
Whichever device you use, the idea is to take interval-timed photographs, covering the whole 360 horizontal and vertical area. 

For vertical coverage it would be necessary one of the following:

- a wide-angle lens in portrait mode for DSLR cameras

- an [adapter kit](https://www.asteroom.com/en/hardware) for mobile phones

- if you are not using a wide-angle lens it will be necessary to shoot 4 more photographs at 90 degrees (or 3 at 60 degrees) tilted to the top and the bottom of the view

This is a general guideline for shooting with regular cameras. A good rule is to overlap the photos for at least **1/3** of each sequential image. However there are many different lenses for DSLR cameras and it is important to know their characteristics, especially the FOV's(Field of View) settings. 

The cost of the equipment is lower, but it takes more time to produce an image.

[**On this page**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/photography-101-how-to-shoot-360-degree-panoramas/) you can find how to us a DSLR  camera to capture spherical panorama

[**Here**](https://www.vrphotography.com/data/pages/techtutorials/technotes/panincrements.html) you can find a guideline for choosing the right amount of overlap depending on the field of view of the lenses.

## Spherical panorama camera/360 camera

This technique uses a camera with one or more [**fish-eye lenses**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens) such as the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-pro/).


The cost of the equipment is higher, but it takes less time to produce an image.

Only one shot is necessary because 
the camera contains multiple camera to cover the 
360 spherical spectrum.

NICOLA PLEASE add textual information on this to explain to people why and how these techniques are different and then add the video as well to find out further information. The video is not enough and we have to have this explicitly written as well.
