## Definition (What)

**Panoramic photographs** are images that visualise a full or partial 360 view of their shooting point. The are not full spherical images and, although they can be mapped onto a spherical representation they lack of information on the top and the bottom part of the image, at most they can be mapped to a cylindrical projection.

**Full 360 Panoramic photographs** are special photographs with the ability to visualise  a full spherical local representation of our shooting point. This is usually *"a 360 photo, also known as a spherical or panorama photo, is an image that offers a complete 360-degree view of a scene in every direction. It allows viewers to explore an image as if they were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by simply dragging the image or tilting their device"* [(Skylum)](https://skylum.com/blog/360-degree-photography)

## Types of projections
We need to remember that when we want to visualise panoramic photographs we go trough the process of capturing 2d flat images of a round space. Later we need to re-map these images onto a round object (or a a cube) to interactively view them. Although for this workshop we will be using an automatic 360 camera like the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/), it is quite important to understand the different [**field of view settings **](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm#angle-of-view) when using a normal camera.
There are different types of projection for mapping panorama images onto a flat surface. The well comprehensive website [Cambridge In Color](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) as a list of different projection types:

- Equirectangular
- Rectilinear
- Cylindrical
- Mercator 
- Fisheye
- Sinusoidal
- Stereographic

The software that we are going use for this workshop uses Equirectangular projection however [**on Cambridge in colour**](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) you can further learn about the technicality of the different types of projections. For advanced learning purposes it is also advisable to experiment with a window program called [**PTAssembler**](https://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm), which gives full control in creating panorama images from single flat photographs.
