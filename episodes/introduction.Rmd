## Definition (What)

**Panoramic photographs** are images that visualise a full or partial 360 view of their shooting point. The are not full spherical images and, although they can be mapped onto a spherical representation they lack of information on the top and the bottom part of the image, at most they can be mapped to a cylindrical projection.

**Full 360 Panoramic photographs** are special photographs with the ability to visualise  a full spherical local representation of our shooting point. This is usually *"a 360 photo, also known as a spherical or panorama photo, is an image that offers a complete 360-degree view of a scene in every direction. It allows viewers to explore an image as if they were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by simply dragging the image or tilting their device"* [(Skylum)](https://skylum.com/blog/360-degree-photography)

## Capturing Images techniques
There are different techniques for capturing 360 panoramas images the main ones are:

### Multiple-shot rotating (Pano Kit)
With this technique the photographer uses a rotating mechanism such as the [Matterport](https://matterport.com/axis) or the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-flow) similar to a turntable so that the camera takes interval timed images, covering the whole 360 horizontal area. For vertical coverage it would be necessary to use a wide angle lens or an [adapter kit](https://www.asteroom.com/en/hardware) so that the whole vertical area is also included in the shots. However this also depend on the brand of the camera.
Another possibility is to use a DSLR camera with a fish-eye lens in manual mode. There are minimal differences between a manual operated set-up and and automatic ones.

### Multiple wide angle lenses (360 panorama camera)
This techniques is used with multiple lenses cameras such as the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-pro/), where only one shot is necessary because multiple images of different angles are captured at the same time, covering the whole 360 spherical spectrum.

Below you can see a brief explanation of the differences in cost, quality and time of using one or the other technique.

> Shooting tips

> - use high f-number when possibble so that everything is in focus

> - set camera to manual focus so that it does not change between different shots

> - keep the sun on the side of the camera and not directly into the lens.

> - keep the camera straight (portrait shooting is ideal when using the first technique because of the extended coverage.

> - Use a small trypod so not to get it in the shot

> - use a timer

## Publishing

### Types of projections
We need to remember that when we want to visualise panoramic photographs we go trough the process of capturing 2d flat images of a round space. Later we need to re-map these images onto a round object (or a a cube) to interactively view them. Although for this workshop we will be using an automatic 360 camera like the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/), it is quite important to understand the different [**field of view settings **](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm#angle-of-view) when using a normal camera.
There are different types of projection for mapping panorama images onto a flat surface. The well comprehensive website [Cambridge In Color](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) as a list of different projection types:

- Equirectangular
- Rectilinear
- Cylindrical
- Mercator 
- Fisheye
- Sinusoidal
- Stereographic

The software that we are going use for this workshop uses Equirectangular projection however [**on Cambridge in colour**](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) you can further learn about the technicality of the different types of projections. For advanced learning purposes it is also advisable to experiment with a window program called [**PTAssembler**](https://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm), which gives full control in creating panorama images from single flat photographs.
