## Definition (What)

**Panoramic photographs** are images that visualise a full or partial 360 view of their shooting point. The are not full spherical images and, although they can be mapped onto a spherical representation they lack of information on the top and the bottom part of the image, at most they can be mapped to a cylindrical projection.

**Full 360 Panoramic photographs** are special photographs with the ability to visualise  a full spherical local representation of our shooting point. This is usually *"a 360 photo, also known as a spherical or panorama photo, is an image that offers a complete 360-degree view of a scene in every direction. It allows viewers to explore an image as if they were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by simply dragging the image or tilting their device"* [(Skylum)](https://skylum.com/blog/360-degree-photography)
