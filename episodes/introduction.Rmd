## Definition (What)

**Panoramic photographs** are images that visualise a full or partial 360 view of their shooting point. The are not full spherical images and, although they can be mapped onto a spherical representation they lack of information on the top and the bottom part of the image, at most they can be mapped to a cylindrical projection.

**Full 360 Panoramic photographs** are special photographs with the ability to visualise  a full spherical local representation of our shooting point. This is usually *"a 360 photo, also known as a spherical or panorama photo, is an image that offers a complete 360-degree view of a scene in every direction. It allows viewers to explore an image as if they were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by simply dragging the image or tilting their device"* [(Skylum)](https://skylum.com/blog/360-degree-photography)

## Capturing Images techniques
There are different techniques for capturing 360 panoramas images the main ones are:

### Multiple-shot rotating (Pano Kit)
With this technique the photographer uses a rotating mechanism such as the [Matterport](https://matterport.com/axis) or the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-flow) similar to a turntable so that the camera takes interval timed images, covering the whole 360 horizontal area. For vertical coverage it would be necessary to use a wide angle lens or an [adapter kit](https://www.asteroom.com/en/hardware) so that the whole vertical area is also included in the shots. However this also depend on the brand of the camera.
Another possibility is to use a DSLR camera with a fish-eye lens in manual mode. There are minimal differences between a manual operated set-up and and automatic ones.

\

### Multiple wide-angle lenses (360 panorama camera)
This techniques is used with multiple lenses cameras such as the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-pro/), where only one shot is necessary because multiple images of different angles are captured at the same time, covering the whole 360 spherical spectrum.

### Shooting tips
 
 - use high f-number when possibble so that everything is in focus
 - set camera to manual focus so that it does not change between different shots
 - keep the sun on the side of the camera and not directly into the lens.
 - keep the camera straight (portrait shooting is ideal when using the first technique because of the extended coverage.
 - Use a small trypod so not to get it in the shot
 - use a timer



## Processing and Stitching


### Dowloading and organizing images onto the computer
Once the images are acquired they will need to be saved on local disk in order to be processed. Each cameras has its own software to save the images. In this workshop we are going to use the Insta360 Pro2 [**stiching software**](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-pro2). For other types of 360 cameras please follow the specific instructions of each camera, however it will be usually  sufficient to download the images by connecting the camera via usb or by extracting the SD card from the camera and inserting it on a card reader to the PC.

Using a suitable name which reflects your project, transfer all images into a folder.

Good practice includes:

    ResourceIDifExistent_NameofObject_DateProcessedinFormatYY.MM.DD
    
Within this folder, create another one named images. Copy the images from the camera into the images folder.

\

The basic step to connect the Insta360 Pro2 camera can be followed on the video tutorial below or found on chapter one of the [Insta360 Pro2 Manual](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_ZWY4eFRLK3JxQWdxU0lDb0pBV2VsZStzM0toVG1xRTJZZUVMd1VVZExpcDJHaElpWm41d0JTMFhJaU9Id0owWA==)

### Stitching the images
The process of stitching images after have been acquired and downloaded to the computer also differ from software to software. Although is not compulsory it is a good practice to learn the software that comes with the camera, especially when the camera is a professional one.

## Vieweing and publishing
There are several methods for viewing and publishing 360 panoramas images:

- **Flat panoramic images (no distortion - orthogonal)**

 Usually these images are considered panoramic view on the horizontal axis but [cannot be joined to form a full 360 spherical representation](https://panoviewer.toolforge.org/#Panorama_of_the_courtyard_of_the_Great_Mosque_of_Kairouan.jpg). They are useful for building measuring purposes and landscape representations. All modern compact cameras they have a mode to produce this kind of images by automatically stitching several photos taken by 
The amount of distortion and a good stitching result will depend on the lens used. With a telephoto lens it will be required more images to cover the full 360 horizontal area. With a more wide angle lens less photos will be required to cover the same amount however it will result im more distortion and in less accurate stitching result.

It dates, in its present form, from the 9th century (under the Aghlabid dynasty).

- **Flat 360 panoramic images (with distortion)**

These are the unwrapped version of the final images that can then be mapped onto a [360 viewer](https://panoviewer.toolforge.org/#Nebel_Schienen_Panorama.jpg)

- **Fish-eye lenses images**

These are the original files that are taken with a fish-eye lens usually they go up to 180 degree of field of view and can be mapped onto a 3d viewer only after processing them with a stitching software  or with a viewer that can project spherical 360 images. In any case they need more then one image in order to cover the full 360 degree spectrum.

- **Mapped onto a 360 viewer**

These images are the final mapped 360 photographs coming from the unrwapped images after stiching several fish-eye lenses photographs.
Although there are several commercial and non-commercial viewers. We are going to use the [Pannellum Online viewer](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/)for its simplicity and the possibility to directly publishing 360 images online.

Go back to the [setup page](../learner/setup.Rmd) and choose one of the church's image by right clicking on it and getting the link, then paste it on the [viewer](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/).

To view your own produced image please upload them to a site that supports [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), e.g. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) and get the link.

### Types of projections

We need to remember that when we want to visualise panoramic photographs we go trough the process of capturing 2d flat images of a round space. Later we need to re-map these images onto a round object (or a a cube) to interactively view them. Although for this workshop we are using an automatic 360 camera, it is quite important to understand the different [**field of view settings**](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm#angle-of-view) when using a normal camera.
There are different types of projection for mapping panorama images onto a flat surface. The well comprehensive website [Cambridge In Color](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) as a list of different projection types:

- Equirectangular
- Rectilinear
- Cylindrical
- Mercator 
- Fisheye
- Sinusoidal
- Stereographic

The stitching software that we used for this workshop returns 360 panorams images with an Equirectangular projection, however on Cambridge in colour [website](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) you can further learn about the technicality of the different types of projections. For advanced learning purposes it is also advisable to experiment windows programs such as [**PTGui**](https://ptgui.com/) or [**PTAssembler**](https://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm), which they give full control in creating panorama images from single flat photographs.
