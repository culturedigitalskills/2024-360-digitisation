A practical exercise in taking spherical panorama photographs would be the best option to start learning some techniques for digitising 360 environments of Cultural Heritage sites.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

Reflect on how to capture some spherical panorama photographs and choose the best position of the environment that you are in.

Try to use different camera settings to enhance the output of the images


:::::::::::::::::::::


In this exercise we are going to try two separate shooting settings one **exterior** and one **interior**, the procedure is very similar the only difference when you are inside is the lower light condition so that you will have to take into consideration the normal setting of any shooting session.

#### Steps for Interior and exterior shooting

1. Please direct yourself to the bottom flour of this building (or any interior buildin halls) and find a suitable position to cover most of the space of the hall. If you decide to go outside instead direct yourself to the opposite garden of the building.

2. Position the tripod on your desired spot

3. Unpack the Insta360 camera from the box and position it on top of the tripod.

4. Make sure the tripod is leveled using the bubble

5. Attach the camera on top of the tripod

6. Attach the two little antennas on top of the camera

7. Switch-on the camera

8. Connect the camera to the  phone App (which you have downloaded at the beginning of this lesson)

9. Set up the app to mono shooting and change the setting of the lighting according with your test and quality of the photograph.

10. Remember to step away from the camera and hide yourself somehwere where the camera will not be able to see you and take a shot

11. In theory you will only need one shot however try to experiment with different position if you have time. (if you do so please try to plan a small shooting tour so that all the parts of the area that you are shooting will be covered)

Basic tips to achieve a good shooting sessions in this exercise are (also see previus section for a more extensive list of tips):

 - Find a good position for the camera
 - Try not to shoot against walls
 - Try not to shoot when the sun is low on the horizon and directly pointing towards one of the camera lens (unless you want to achieve a particular effects)
