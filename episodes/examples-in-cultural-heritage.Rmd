Spherical panorama images are popular for documenting Cultural Heritage, because:

- Allow to visualise an accurate and rich representation of cultural environment from a vantage point.
- They give the viewer the possibility to explore the surroundings of a certain environment with ease. 
- Allow to create Virtual Tours (not to be confused with 3D virtual tours which come from video game techniques).


The article: [**Panoramic 360◦ Sphere: Digitization and Mobilization of Cultural Heritage Site and Story Visualizing of History for Cultural Tourism, by Ylenia Cariani**](https://www.silvher.eu/2021/01/04/panoramic-360%E2%97%A6-sphere-digitization-and-mobilization-of-cultural-heritage-site-and-story-visualizing-of-history-for-cultural-tourism/) highlights the benefits of spherical panorama for cultural tourism.

::::: challenge

Think on how spherical panorama might provide different or complementary
information to 3D models acquired using photogrammetry.

In which cases does it make sense to deploy 360 photography within the
context of your project?

::::: 

<!---
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

Reflect on how the examples described could 
apply to the objects and
environments you would like to document.

List ideas where spherical panoramas might be a useful documentation
technology.
