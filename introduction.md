## Brief History of panoramic representations

The idea of panoramic representation can be traced back to 20 A.D for example with the frescos in the houses in Pompeii[^1] (and probably even before). Techniques to capture panoramic views in photography started as early as photography itself. It was mostly used by photographers who were making a series of consequent photos, to show the whole city viewed from an elevated point. This is because a single photograph from far away could not show enough details of the scene.[^2]

When considering panoramic photographs we must be aware of certain terminology, this is because there are different techniques involved. Firstly we must differentiate between a [raster **digital image**](https://culturedigitalskills.github.io/2024-3d-digitisation-methods/types-of-media.html#digital-images) and a [vectorised **3D environment**](https://culturedigitalskills.github.io/2024-3d-digitisation-methods/types-of-media.html#vector-data) which allows
for interactivity, for example when visualising immersive 360 environments (e.g. VR).

In this lesson, we focus on the 
<!--are not going to explore either VR immersive environments being made with spherical stereographic photographs or with full 3D explorable settings (3D engines and video games). The purpose here is to understand the -->
process of digitising and visualising panorama digital images or photographs for cultural heritage.



## Panorama photographs

These are digital images which captures a 360 / wide-angle 
horizontal view or a broad perspective of a scene.

The digital images can be re-projected onto a cylinder or a sphere 
for visualisation. Although they can lack information when re-projecting on a sphere.

## Spherical panorama photographs

A spherical panorama photograph captures a full view of a 
scene in every direction, both horizontally and vertically, 
from the shooting point. 
Unlike traditional panoramas that cover a wide horizontal span, 
spherical panoramas allow viewers to look in 
any direction. 

It also known as a **photosphere**, **360-degree panorama** or **spherical panorama**. 
With special interactive viewers, it is possible to explore the image as if we were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by allowing the user to rotate with three degress of freedom interactivity[^3].

All panoramas can be created using specialized panoramic cameras, 
wide-angle lenses, or by using software to stitch together 
photos taken from a single vantage point.
