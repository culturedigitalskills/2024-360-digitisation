## Brief History of panoramic representations

The idea of panoramic representation can be traced back to 20 A.D  with the frescos in the houses in Pompeii for example[^1] and probably even before. Techniques to capture panoramic view in photography started as early as photography itself. It was mostly used by photographers which where making a series of consequent photos, to show the whole city viewed from an elevated point. This is because a single photograph from far away could not show enough details of the scene.[^2]

> When considering panoramic photographs we must be aware of certain terminolgy, this is because there are different techniques for visualising immersive environments. This techniques are applied depending on the user final outcome and purpose. In this lesson we are not going to explore neither VR immersive environments being made whith spherical stereographic photograph nor with full 3D explorable settings (3D engines and videogames). The purpose here is to understand the process of capturing and visualising spherical panorama photogrpahs for cultural heritage environment digitisation.



## Panorama photographs

These are photographs of a full or partial 360 horizontal view of their shooting point. 

The are not fully spherical images and, although they can be mapped onto a sphere they lack of information on the top and the bottom part of the image, at most they can be mapped to a cylindrical projection.

## Spherical panorama photographs

These are special photographs of a full spherical view from the shooting point. 
Usually a processed photo, also known as a **photosphere** or simply **spherical panorama**. It is an image that offers a complete 360-degree view of a scene in every direction. With special interactive viewers it is possible to explore the image as if we were standing right in the middle of it, experiencing the entire surroundings by simply dragging the image or tilting the device[^3].
