## Capturing Images techniques
There are different techniques for capturing 360 panoramas images the main ones are:

### Multiple-shot rotating (Pano Kit)
With this technique the photographer uses a rotating mechanism such as the [Matterport](https://matterport.com/axis) or the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-flow) similar to a turntable so that the camera takes interval timed images, covering the whole 360 horizontal area. For vertical coverage it would be necessary to use a wide angle lens or an [adapter kit](https://www.asteroom.com/en/hardware) so that the whole vertical area is also included in the shots. However this also depend on the brand of the camera.
Another possibility is to use a DSLR camera with a fish-eye lens in manual mode. There are minimal differences between a manual operated set-up and and automatic ones.

### Multiple wide-angle lenses (360 panorama camera)
This techniques is used with multiple lenses cameras such as the [Insta360](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-pro/), where only one shot is necessary because multiple images of different angles are captured at the same time, covering the whole 360 spherical spectrum.

| Disposition of two Kodak SP360 video cameras. Each camera has a 360° (N-S-E-W) plus 214° angle of view. As both cameras are placed opposite to each other, there is a 34° overlap in the images and a ≈ 50-cm blind spot between the cameras., Juliana López Marulanda, under [ CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0), via [Researchgate Commons](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Disposition-of-two-Kodak-SP360-video-cameras-Each-camera-has-a-360-N-S-E-W-plus-214_fig2_314880330) |

### Shooting tips
 
 - use high f-number when possibble so that everything is in focus
 - set camera to manual focus so that it does not change between different shots
 - keep the sun on the side of the camera and not directly into the lens.
 - keep the camera straight (portrait shooting is ideal when using the first technique because of the extended coverage.
 - Use a small trypod so not to get it in the shot
 - use a timer
