## Types of projections

When we want to visualise spherical panorama photographs, we go through the process of <!--capturing flat images with a fisheye lens,
stitching them resulting in a distorted image and -->
mapping the result on a curved surface. 

This allows the viewer to explore 
the image by turning around 
the *virtual* camera left, right, up and down.

<!--For this to happen, the software needs to map the distorted images onto a sphere or cube (in this case the original images are not distorted) to interactively view them. 

Although for this workshop we are using an automatic 360 camera, it is important to understand the different [**field of view settings**](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/cameras-vs-human-eye.htm#angle-of-view) when using a normal camera.
-->

There are different types of projection for mapping panorama images onto a flat surface, including:

- Equirectangular
- Rectilinear
- Cylindrical
- Mercator 
- Fisheye
- Sinusoidal
- Stereographic

<!--This [Cambridge In Color website](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm)offers comprehensive information on these types of projections.-->

The stitching software that we used for this workshop returns 360 images with an Equirectangular projection, however you can further learn about the technicality of the different types of [projections](https://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-projections.htm) .

For advanced learning purposes, it is also advisable to experiment with applications such as [**PTGui**](https://ptgui.com/) or [**PTAssembler**](https://www.tawbaware.com/ptasmblr.htm). They give full control in creating panorama images from single flat photographs. 


There are several methods for viewing and publishing panorama images:

### Flat panoramic images (no distortion - orthogonal)

 Usually, these images are considered panoramic views on the horizontal axis but [cannot be joined to form a full 360 spherical representation](https://panoviewer.toolforge.org/#Panorama_of_the_courtyard_of_the_Great_Mosque_of_Kairouan.jpg). 
 
They are useful for building measuring purposes and landscape representations. All modern compact cameras they have a mode to produce this kind of image by automatically stitching several photographs taken from a single point of rotation.

<!--The amount of distortion and a good stitching result will depend on the lens used. With a telephoto lens, there will be necessary more images to cover the full 360 horizontal area. 

> With a wider angle lens fewer photos will be required to cover the same amount of area, however, the result can present more distortion errors and less accurate stitching results.-->

### Fish-eye lenses images

Usually they go up to 180 degrees of field of view. They can be mapped onto a 3D viewer after processing them with stitching software or with a viewer that can project spherical 360 images.

### Spherical panorama images (with distortion)

These are the unwrapped versions of the images resulting from stitching the photograph taken with a fish-eye lens. They can be fully mapped onto a [360 viewer](https://panoviewer.toolforge.org/#Nebel_Schienen_Panorama.jpg).

## Mapping images onto a 360 viewer

<!--These images are the final mapped 360 photographs coming from the unwrapped images after stitching several fish-eye lens photographs.-->
There are several commercial and non-commercial viewers for mapping 360 photographs.

We are going to use the [Pannellum Online viewer](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/) for its simplicity and the possibility of directly publishing 360 images online. The viewer was developed by [Matthew Petroff](https://mpetroff.net/) and the full publication can be found: [https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01628](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01628)

Go back to the [setup page](../learner/setup.Rmd) and choose one of the church's images by right clicking on it and getting the link, then paste it on the [viewer](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/).

To view your own produced image please upload them to a site that supports [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), e.g. [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) and get the link.
