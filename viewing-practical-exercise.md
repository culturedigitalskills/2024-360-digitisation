images acquired during the lesson or images already available.

- Suggests software to use for publishing.

NICOLA PLEASE Describe in a comprehensive text how an exercise in done separately from presenting the viewing method (as in the previous episode) 
</span> -->
In this section we will explore how to view and publish spherical panorama images after they have been acquired and processed.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

Collect the processed spherical panorama images and prepare them to view them online.

Choose a spherical interactive viewer that best suits your purposes


:::::::::::::::::::::


Once the photographs have been captured you will need to download them onto the computer, process them and publish the result to be viewed in different formats.
Try to follow this basic steps to achieve a good result:

1. Get the camera out of the box and place it on a secure area near the computer (you can also use the tripod for better security)

2. Connect the camera to the computer via Ethernet or by other means [(pleas see section 6 of this document)](processing-stitching.Rmd)

3. Follow the steps in section [6 of this document](processing-stitching.Rmd) downloading and stitching

4. Once you have your spherical panorama stitched files choose one of your stitched images and upload it onto a web server such as [D4Science](https://accounts.d4science.org/auth/realms/d4science/protocol/openid-connect/auth?scope=openid&response_type=code&state=24965829E4B1F86C390E7F7D656310AD.infra-gateway1&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fservices.d4science.org%2Fc%2Fportal%2Flogin&login=true&client_id=services.d4science.org), [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)  or [Wekemedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&returnto=Main+Page) (you need to create an account for these last two)

5. Once the file are uploaded get the URL link of the image and past it into the first box of [Pannellum viewer](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/)

6. Congratulation you are viewng your first spherical panorama photograph online!

7. Get the URL link of the result or the embedding code and past it in one of your social media or personal page if you want to.

8. Congratulation you have just published the first spherical panorama image!



There are may interactive viewers for spherical panorama photographs some more basic while other more advance.[The Pannellum viewer](https://pannellum.org) is a good starting point because is open source and customizable. With Pannelum and other viewers it will also be possible to create Virtual tours, however it is out of the scope of this exercise to learn how to create this type of visualisation. If you want to further explore this type of publication here is a list of tools that you may be able to use for your project:



- Pannellum [Online](https://pannellum.org/documentation/overview/tutorial/) or [self- hosted](https://pannellum.org/download/).
- [Google Streetview](https://www.google.com/streetview/) 
- [Marzipano](https://www.marzipano.net/)

- [Matterport](https://matterport.com/en-gb).
