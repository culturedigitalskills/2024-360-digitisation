## Standard camera setup and acquisition

### DSLR cameras

NICOLA PLEASE: add basics of setting up a camera. You can use some of the text below. Explain why a timer is needed. Be more comprehensive.

As we saw in the previous section this is one of the technique for taking spherical panorama photographs. When using this technique we should follow these specific steps:

- Position the tripod at the view point where you want to take the photographs from and make sure is leveled with the bubble.

- Mount the rotating (mount) mechanism on the tripod. The mount can be operated with a remote or with a specialised app.

- Mount the camera on top of the rotating mount turn it on and make sure is leveled trough the camera level function.

- Keep the camera straight using a level function of the camera or the level of the tripod.

- Turn your camera in portrait mode, this is ideal when shooting spherical panoramas because of the extended vertical coverage.

- Set camera to manual focus so that it does not change between different shots. In this istance try to focu to infinity if your lens permits such a function. To increase Focal Lenght try to use high high f-stops number, especially if you are outside in good light conditions.

- Adjust the light settings for acquiring well lighted photographs. You should be already  familiar with this settings. If you need some help you can consult [this guideline](https://capturetheatlas.com/camera-settings/)

- Start shooting by rotating the camera of a minimum 60 degree angle (this depends on the focal length of your lens) Please refer to the [previous section](difference-between-techniques.Rmd) to check the amount of pictures to be taken.

- To speed up the process you can use a [motorized camera mount](https://www.manfrotto.com/global/genie-ii-pan-tilt-sy0031-0001/) synchronized with the timer of the camera. In this case:

  - Setup the number of photographs to be taken on your camera.
  
  - Setup the interval time on your rotating mount.
  
  - Start the process.

### Compact cameras and mobile phones 
Using a compact camera or a mobile phone to shoot spherical panorama photographs are slightly different than using a DSLR or a specialized 360 camera.
To use this equipment you will need to follow this basic steps:

- Position the tripod at the view point where you want to take the photographs from and make sure is leveled with the bubble.

- Mount the [rotating (mount) mechanism](https://www.manfrotto.com/global/move-quick-release-system-mvaqr/) on the tripod.

- Mount the camera or the mobile phone (with a [tripod adapter](https://www.manfrotto.com/global/products/smartphones-action-cameras-drones/smartphone-accessories/)) on top of the rotating mount and turn it on and make sure is leveled with the level function.

- Adjust the light setting on the camera or on the app. Setting for acquiring well lighted photographs are the same setting for standard DSRL cameras (although there are some limitations on compact cameras and mobile phones). You should be already  familiar with this settings. If you need some help you can consult [this guideline](https://capturetheatlas.com/camera-settings/)

- Start shooting the first photograph.

- Rotate the mount at the desired angle degree (please refer to [previous section](differences-between.techniques.Rmd)) using the remote control to the next position.

- Take the next shot until completing the full 360 rotation

- To speed up the process you can use a compact camera [motorized camera mount](https://www.manfrotto.com/global/pixi-pano360-remotely-controlled-motorized-head-mhpixi360/) synchronized with the timer of the camera (if the camera offers this function otherwise take manual shots with the remote of the camera). In this case:

  - Setup the number of photographs to be taken on your camera.
  
  - Setup the interval time on your rotating mount.
  
  - Start the process.
  
- To speed up the process with a mobile phone you can use a  mobile phone mount like the [monfrotto](https://www.manfrotto.com/global/pixi-pano360-remotely-controlled-motorized-head-mhpixi360/) or the [Insta360 Flow](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-flow) with the proprietary app. In this case:

  - Setup the app so that it will take a full 360 rotation.
  
  - Start the process.

## 360 camera setup and acquisition

The second technique for taking spherical panorama photographs, as we saw previously, is by using a 360 camera. Lets see the steps for setting up and achieving a faster shooting session. Although these steps are specific for the Insta360 Pro 2, they remain easily applicable to other types of 360 cameras:

- Position the tripod at the view point where you want to take the photographs from and make sure is leveled with the bubble.

- Mount the camera on the tripod.

- Turn on the camera, turn on the wifi(or the bluetooth).

- Turn on the bluetooth on your phone, find the camera an connect to it.

- Open the [control camera App](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-pro2) and connect to it (for the Insta360 you can follow the tutorial on the app.

- Keep the camera straight using a level function of the camera app.

- Adjust the light setting on the app. Setting for acquiring well lighted photographs are the same setting for standard DSRL cameras. You should be already  familiar with this settings. If you need some help you can consult [this guideline](https://capturetheatlas.com/camera-settings/)

- Start taking the first photographs. This will be a series of 6 photograph for mono viewing or 12 for stereo viewing.



## Shooting tips

- Use a good quality tripod for maximum stabilisation. However try to use a not too large tripod to avoid to much editing of the final image.

- Keep the sun on the side of the camera and do not position the camera directly looking at the sun.

- In all cases use a remote control or a dedicated app for taking photographs to avoid camera movements.

- Alwyas try to acquire the photographs in raw format as they contain more colour information. Later it will be possible to convert them with softwre such as [Raw Therapee](https://www.rawtherapee.com/)
