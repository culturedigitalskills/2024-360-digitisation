## Dowloading and organizing images onto the computer

Once the images are acquired they will need to be saved on local disk in order to be processed. Each cameras has its own software to save the images. 


In this workshop we are going to use the Insta360 Pro2 [**stiching software**](https://www.insta360.com/download/insta360-pro2). 


For other types of 360 cameras please follow the specific instructions of each camera, however it will be usually  sufficient to download the images by connecting the camera via usb or by extracting the SD card from the camera and inserting it on a card reader of the PC.

Using a suitable name which reflects your project, transfer all images into a folder.

Good practice includes:

    ResourceIDifExistent_NameofObject_DateProcessedinFormatYY.MM.DD
    
Within this folder, create another one named images. Copy the images from the camera into the images folder.

 - Turn on the camera

 - Start by going to storage device on the camera

 - Connect the camera with the LAN cable to the computer (in this case if you also need internet connection pleas use your WIFI)
 
 - Enter the IP address of the camera into your file explorer: 192.168.1.188\pro2 (for Mac users go to connect to server and type 192.168.1.188 then connect as guest and choose pro2)
 
 - Check that all the files are there
 
 - Open the Sticher software and go to the Cam file manager and click import Method 2
 
 - Type the IP into the address bar 192.168.1.188
 
 - Select the SDcard folder
 
 - Click import to local drive
 
 - Select the location above mentioned and import the images
 
 
 

 


The basic step to connect the Insta360 Pro2 camera can be also followed on the video tutorial below starting from part 2 at 1.00 min or found on chapter one of the [Insta360 Pro2 Manual](https://data.d4science.org/shub/E_ZWY4eFRLK3JxQWdxU0lDb0pBV2VsZStzM0toVG1xRTJZZUVMd1VVZExpcDJHaElpWm41d0JTMFhJaU9Id0owWA==)

## Stitching the images
The process of stitching images after have been acquired and downloaded to the computer also differ from software to software. Although not compulsory it is a good practice to learn the software that comes with the camera, especially when the camera is a professional one.

The basic steps for stitching the images are:

- Open the Insta360 Stitcher

- Drag the folder containing the images to the left window of the interface

- Adjust the setting on the right side of the interface:

  - Content type: monoscopic
  - Stitching mode: new optical flow
  - Sampling type: fast
  - Blender type : auto
  - Leave the other setting and click Preview Stitching effect
    - Try Zenith optimization at the bottom of the window
    - Drag the image if you want to change the center viewing point
  - Close the window and go to output settings
    - choose the resolution
    -choose the output folder (the one you set above)
    - choose the file name and extension (Usually .jpg unless you need uncompressed file, then choos .tiff)
  - Click stitch now
